/*8.1 Implement and compare the total head movement for a given sequence of disk requests using two 
specific scheduling algorithms: 
• System Setup: A disk with cylinders numbered 0 to 499. 
• Current Head Position: 85 
• Pending Requests (FIFO order): 10, 229, 39, 400, 18, 145, 120, 480, 20, 250 
• Algorithms to Implement: 
• C-SCAN (Assume initial movement is towards 499). 
• C-LOOK (Assume initial movement is towards 499). 
• Output: Calculate and display the sequence of cylinder movements and the Average Seek Distance 
for both C-SCAN and C-LOOK. Conclude which algorithm performed better for this request set. */

// C-Look and LOOK Difference: 
// C-Look is a more efficient version of LOOK, as it only services requests in one direction and jumps back to the beginning without going to the end of the disk.
// This reduces the overall seek time and improves performance, especially in systems with a high number of requests.

// C-Scan and SCAN Difference:
// C-Scan treats the disk as a circular list, servicing requests in one direction and jumping back to the start without servicing requests on the return trip.
// This can lead to more uniform wait times for requests compared to SCAN, which services requests in both directions.
